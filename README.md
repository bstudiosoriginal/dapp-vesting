This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started


First install all required packages with 
```bash
npm install 
```
Deploying on hardhat for testing


Second deploy the contracts by first launching your own local network using hardhat and then deploying the scripts. You will normally deploy in a separate process.
 ```bash
 # process 1
 npx hardhat node  
 # process 2
 npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
 ```

Third, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
